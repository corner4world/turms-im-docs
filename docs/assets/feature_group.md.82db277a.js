If the system administrator (note: users do not have permission to modify the group type) modify the group policy to &quot;question-and-answer based&quot; policy to allow new users to join the group, then the previously received request to join the group will not be deleted by the system. When the group administrator tries to approve these group entry requests, the server will also notify the group policy of the change and reject the approval.
