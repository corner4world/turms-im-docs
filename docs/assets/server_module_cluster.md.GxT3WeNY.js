If you develop it yourself, you can ensure that new requirements are realized immediately. The time required to complete a new requirement is roughly 5-60 minutes, and there is no need to write Hacky Code</td><td>Others do not necessarily provide customized functions. Even if it is done, it is usually weeks, months, or even years before new features are released to new versions. Such low efficiency is absolutely unacceptable</td></tr><tr><td>Difficulty of Learning</td><td>Services are clearly divided, codes are streamlined, and aspects can be quickly learned and mastered. Spend 10 to 30 minutes to train some basic newcomers, and newcomers can master Turms cluster services</td><td>Projects like ZooKeeper or Eureka, which are only about a certain function of microservices, have far more source code than the six major Turms below The sum of service source code. Moreover, third-party services also involve some relatively complex but completely useless functions for Turms, such as Zookeeper&#39;s Zab protocol, which only increases the difficulty of learning. To grasp the details of its implementation requires a lot of practice and source code reading</td></tr><tr><td>Implementation Difficulty</td><td>The implementation difficulty of the cluster service code is low. For example, the total difficulty of Turms&#39; cluster service implementation is far lower than the &quot;AC automaton algorithm based on double array Trie&quot; mentioned in the &quot;sensitive word filtering&quot; function. <br>In addition, the implementation difficulty of cluster services is much lower than the implementation of IM business logic</td><td>Need to write Adapter code according to the characteristics of third-party services. Although the difficulty is low, due to the complexity of the source code of the third-party service, it is not easy to ensure that the Adapter code will always execute as expected (using the time of learning the source code of various third-party services + writing the Adapter code, it has been possible to start from Zero self-developed several sets of cluster services have been realized)</td></tr><tr><td>Deployment and O&amp;M Difficulty</td><td>In Turms&#39; cluster services, only the &quot;Configuration Center Service&quot; and &quot;Service Registry&quot; require MongoDB services for deployment, and both share MongoDB services. Therefore:<br>1. Since business data storage also uses MongoDB service, operation and maintenance personnel can choose to share a MongoDB service without additional deployment<br>2. Both domestic and foreign cloud vendors provide MongoDB service deployment services. You can deploy a single instance or a clustered MongoDB service with just a few clicks of the mouse, and directly realize disaster recovery in the same city</td><td>Most of the &quot;configuration center service&quot; and &quot;service registration center&quot; services supported by domestic and foreign cloud vendors are bound to specific vendors, allowing deployment flexibility very bad. On the other hand, if Turms adopts an open source solution such as Eureka, since various vendors do not provide cloud services for open source solutions such as Eureka, the operation and maintenance personnel have to purchase cloud servers for deployment and operation and maintenance by themselves. , greatly participated in the difficulty of operation and maintenance</td></tr><tr><td>Performance</td><td>Turms can combine the characteristics of business code, so that the implementation of cluster services can coordinate with each other, ensuring that no redundant data is generated throughout the process. At the same time, all network operations are implemented based on Netty, with extremely high performance</td><td>Since third-party services are based on general requirements, we have to write a lot of Adapter code for this, which increases resource overhead and makes learning more difficult. On the other hand, its own implementation cannot guarantee extreme efficiency, and some services even use blocking API</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In summary, there is almost no advantage in using third-party services, so Turms adopts a purely self-developed solution. In addition, in fact, companies with a little strength and a little customization need will choose self-research for the same reason as above.</p><h2 id="node" tabindex="-1">node <a class="header-anchor" href="#node" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;node&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Implementation class: <code>im.turms.server.common.infra.cluster.node.Node</code></p><p>Configuration class: <code>im.turms.server.common.infra.property.env.common.cluster.NodeProperties</code></p><p>Each server has one and only one node class instance.

Taking the implementation of the configuration center as an example, the implementation solutions include: ConfigMaps of K8S, configuration services of cloud service vendors (such as AppConfig of AWS), and open source implementations (such as Zookeeper). As Turms is a technology-neutral open source project, its technology stack must not be bound by vendors. But at the same time, it is necessary to ensure that these implementations can be easily supported by cloud service vendors, so that operation and maintenance personnel can &quot;implement and deploy with a click of a mouse.&quot; At the same time, it must meet various key features such as disaster tolerance, high availability, monitorability, and easy operation. Therefore, Turms implements the configuration center through MongoDB self-development to meet all the above requirements.</p><p>The addition, deletion, modification, and query operations of the specific configuration are implemented as the addition, deletion, modification, and query operations of the conventional MongoDB database, which is very routine, so I won’t go into details.

The reason for this is to use large-spacing IDs to ensure that when these data are stored in the MongoDB database, MongoDB can generate enough Chunks based on these IDs, and load-balance these Chunks to each MongoDB server for storage. . The monotonically increasing ID will cause all new data to be always allocated to the only hotspot MongoDB server, causing the load balancing of the database to fail.</p><p>The implementation of large-spacing ID is also very simple, just rearrange the fields, the specific order is: <code>serial number, time stamp, data center ID, work node ID</code> (the ID order of the conventional snowflake algorithm is <code>time stamp, data Center ID, worker node ID, serial number</code>). Since the serial number occupies the highest bit of the ID, and the generated serial number is monotonically increasing in the interval [0, 1023], it can ensure that the generated ID quickly occupies a large range of values, and is divided into multiple Chunks by MongoDB and stored in a load-balanced manner.
