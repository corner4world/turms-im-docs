Most of the other design details also come from commercial IM projects.</p><p>And compared to many projects with obsolete technology stacks, Turms is also the only open source IM solution that is based on modern architecture and modern technology and is suitable for medium to large scale applications.</p><p>In addition, architecture design is an art of trade-off. Some IM products take rich features as their slogan at the cost of no support for medium to large scale applications (they are only suitable for team communications). However, Turms takes extreme performance as the first priority and supports complete (rather than rich) IM features to support medium and large-scale applications. Please refer to <a href="https://turms-im.github.io/docs/design/schema" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Turms Schema Design</a> and <a href="https://turms-im.github.io/docs/server/module/observability" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Observability</a> for details.</p><p>When you need to compare Turms with other open source IM projects for features, you can first compare Turms with other open source IM projects based on the following features of Turms. Usually, you can find the differences between professional IM projects and amateur IM projects. In addition, under the chapter of <code>Product Comparison</code>, we also mentioned the shortcomings of the Turms project for your reference.</p><p>Note: The main disadvantage of the current Turms project is that it does not provide support for living/chat room. The technical implementation of the living/chat room is not difficult, but the product requirements, quality attribute requirements, and restrictive conditions are quite different from the scenarios of general social applications, so the first version of Turms does not provide support for it. In addition, Turms is also not suitable for small-scale enterprise communication scenarios. Using Turms for enterprise communication scenarios is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, because enterprise communication emphasizes feature-rich rather than extreme performance, which is inconsistent with the goals of Turms, so their designs are also different. If you want to support enterprise communication scenarios, you need to develop based on Turms yourselves.</p><h3 id="business-features" tabindex="-1">Business Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#business-features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Business Features&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li>Support a complete set of <a href="https://turms-im.github.io/docs/feature/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">IM features</a>.

Of course, you can also modify the source code. For example, the plugin turms-plugin-minio based on turms-plugin is used to interact with MinIO server.</li><li>(Flexibility) Turms provides hundreds of configuration properties for developers to meet various requirements.

Any project will inevitably have new business requirements after business growth, which needs to be customized. However, IM clouds either do not provide customized services or require high customization fees, and they may misunderstand your requirements, resulting in customized features that cannot meet your business needs well. It will take long-term cooperation to works well with them.<br>But based on Turms, your requirements can be implemented and provided quickly, and the cost is low.<br>Note: For details of the complexity of IM, you can refer to <a href="https://turms-im.github.io/docs/design/schema#%E9%9C%80%E6%B1%82%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90%E4%B8%8E%E9%9B%86%E5%90%88%E7%BB%93%E6%9E%84%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Schema Design</a><br>2.
