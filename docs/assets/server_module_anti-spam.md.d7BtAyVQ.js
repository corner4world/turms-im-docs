There is no implementation of an algorithm and code quality like turms-plugin-antispam, and the overall implementation of traditional anti-spam solutions (not involving machine learning) is not difficult, so Turms chooses self-developed, and also contributes to many later expansions. fully prepared. in particular:</p><ul><li>Those who know algorithms do not know engineering design, and those who know engineering design do not know how to do algorithms. On the one hand, it is difficult to implement the AC automaton algorithm based on the double array Trie, and the data structure design of Java is relatively conservative, such as <code>String</code> and <code>StringBuilder</code>. In order to ensure the isolation of internal data and external data, many functions will involve For memory copy work, it is necessary for engineers to have basic optimization awareness to avoid various Java &quot;pitfalls&quot; in algorithm implementation. On the other hand, the logic of the anti-spam design and algorithm implementation in Turms is unified, and they are all designed for the IM project of Turms and serve the actual IM needs. Therefore, it can be guaranteed that &quot;the functions that can be imagined can be realized, and the unnecessary functions do not need to be provided, so as to avoid unnecessary time and space overhead&quot;.</li><li>Self-research can customize the algorithm implementation and the upstream and downstream codes of the algorithm according to the project requirements to ensure absolute efficiency (press the space complexity to O(1), time complexity to O(n), and ensure that one side of the string is traversed Sensitive word matching can be completed). For example, in the implementation of the AC automaton standard algorithm, the logic of &quot;skipping a certain character for matching&quot; is not involved. Then if we want to achieve &quot;only detect code points in BMP&quot;, we need to filter and copy a new char[] before passing the original char[] to the standard AC algorithm, and then pass it to the AC automaton to match. This frequent memory copy work is undoubtedly very inefficient and unnecessary, especially the &quot;user text message&quot; itself is the most memory-intensive and frequently occurring data among all user requests. However, if a custom implementation is used, we only need to add an if judgment condition to skip the character directly when the AC automaton performs matching. It is simple and clear, and does not need to open up a new memory space, so the space efficiency is high.</li></ul>`,34),s=[i];function r(d,l,c,u,p,h){return a(),t("div",null,s)}const f=e(n,[["render",r]]);export{g as __pageData,f as default};
