The notification has the <code>USER_IS_BLOCKED</code> status code, telling the client that it is Banned. After the data is flushed, the Turms server automatically disconnects the underlying TCP connection.</p><p>When turms-gateway checks that the peer IP of the newly established TCP connection has been banned, or detects that the user ID sending the login request has been banned, by default, turms-gateway will directly close the TCP connection with it, and will not A notification of the reason for connection closure will be sent, such as &quot;Your IP/User ID has been blocked for XX time&quot;.</p><p>There are two points to note:</p><ul><li><p>turms-gateway itself cannot refuse to connect with the banned IP before the TCP connection is established. If you want the server to refuse to connect to the banned IP before the TCP handshake, you can use the callback plug-in provided after Turms to notify the cloud service security system to ban the IP, so as to completely realize the IP ban .</p><p>In addition, the reason why we do not call the system service to completely block the IP is because: when the server is forcibly shut down, the blocked IP will not be automatically removed; modifying the underlying network configuration by ourselves may interfere with the cloud service&#39;s own network The management service conflicts, causing the server to be abnormal.</p></li><li><p>When the client connects or logs in, turms-gateway will actively disconnect the connection with the banned IP or user, but it will not send a notification of the reason for the connection closure. The advantages of doing this are: 1. The bandwidth of the cloud service is charged according to the outbound bandwidth, and the inbound bandwidth is not charged, so turms-gateway does not send a response on the business layer, which can slow down the bandwidth cost incurred when being attacked by DDoS; 2. Reduce information exposure and try not to provide effective information to hackers</p></li></ul><h4 id="automatic-ban-mechanism" tabindex="-1">Automatic ban mechanism <a class="header-anchor" href="#automatic-ban-mechanism" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Automatic ban mechanism&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The timings that currently support automatic detection and banning of clients are:</p><ul><li><p>When the user sends requests frequently and reaches a certain number of times</p></li><li><p>When the WebSocket frame sent by the user does not conform to the specification or is too large, and reaches a certain number of times.

That is, each server holds a weakly consistent copy of the Map, and one or more Redis servers store a reference copy, and also records the logs of each blocking and unblocking behavior for each server Do incremental sync. When a new server goes online or a server&#39;s local logs data lags behind by 100,000 records, these servers will request full synchronization from Redis, otherwise the server only needs to request incremental logs from Redis at the default interval of 10 seconds to synchronize the local copy .</p><p>In addition, the causal consistency implementation currently adopted by Turms is: the order of blocking and unblocking actions is based on the insertion order of the blocked logs queue in Redis, and each server performs causal synchronization based on the order of logs in the queue to ensure that the client is blocked The eventual consistency of the data.</p><h5 id="why-not-use-bloom-filter" tabindex="-1">Why not use Bloom Filter <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-not-use-bloom-filter" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why not use Bloom Filter&quot;">​</a></h5><p>The theoretical solution to realize the blacklist function based on Bloom Filter is widely known, but in fact, Bloom Filter has many pitfalls in this scenario, specifically:</p><ul><li><p>The features and engineering practices supported by Bloom Filter are limited. such as:</p><ul><li>In a distributed environment, how to judge the order of &quot;ban operation&quot; and &quot;unblock operation&quot;, and how to ensure the final consistency</li><li>How to set different ban durations for different banned users (such as five minutes/half an hour)</li><li>How to add additional information to additional banned users, such as the reason for being blocked</li><li>How to synchronize the blacklist list between nodes, how to do incremental synchronization</li><li>How to implement &quot;unblocking operation&quot; and what is the cost</li></ul><p>To sum up, even the most basic functions of the blacklist system cannot be realized by Bloom Filter in a distributed environment.

But a special function of the leaky bucket algorithm is that it can limit the flow of downstream services (the most important one is the database). However, there is also a price for downstream flow limiting. It requires the operation and maintenance personnel to accurately estimate the downstream service throughput, otherwise it may cause the downstream service to be idle while the upstream service is limiting the flow.</p><p>In addition, the use of MPSC queues to cache requests not only reduces throughput, but also increases memory overhead and GC times, resulting in poor user experience and exacerbating the effect of DDoS attacks. (Supplement: By reading the source code of the Turms server, you will find that in the process of processing client requests in Turms, the code is as &quot;light&quot; as possible, so using the MPSC queue for each user session is considered a heavy operation)</p><p>In summary, the Turms server finally uses the <code>token bucket algorithm</code>.</p><p>In particular, compared to the traditional HTTP server, the CPU and memory system resources required to receive and process a regular HTTP request and response may be hundreds of times the system resources required for the interaction between the Turms server and its client (for example: except The network layer protocol header, the average size of a request from the Turms client is about 32B). Therefore, there is no need to take the sudden Turms client requests of a small number of users too seriously. The system resources used to process hundreds of Turms client requests may be similar to processing one HTTP request (of course, there are other forms of CC attacks that will cause a lot of resource consumption).</p><p>other:</p><ul><li>turms-gateway does not support and currently does not plan to support the implementation of global current limiting.
