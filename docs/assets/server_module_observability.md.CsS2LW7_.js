If a server does not provide support for the observability system, no matter how rich its functions are, it is just a toy project.</p><p>Moreover, the derivative products generated under the observability system are also an important asset of the enterprise. If business operators ignore the construction of the observability system, they will not be able to effectively analyze user behavior and preferences, let alone optimize business strategies , It also means that the company has given up a considerable amount of wealth.</p><p>Turms, like other conventional servers, divides the specific implementation of observability into three categories, namely: <code>metrics (aggregated values)</code>, <code>logs (events)</code>, <code>link tracking (request-oriented)</code>.</p><h2 id="metrics" tabindex="-1">metrics <a class="header-anchor" href="#metrics" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;metrics&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Metrics are composed of aggregated values, and are generally divided into <code>system metrics</code>, <code>application metrics</code> and <code>business metrics</code>. System metrics are used to observe the running status and trends of the system or container; application metrics are used to observe the running status and trends of the JVM and Turms application layer; business metrics are used to observe the status and trends of business development. In the case of non-displacement sampling by default, it only takes up a very small part of the memory space.</p><p>In addition, in terms of specific code implementation, Turms&#39; measurement system is implemented based on the mainstream measurement sampling library <a href="https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Micrometer</a>.

There are two categories of logs in Turms, namely <code>application logs</code> and <code>business logs</code>. The number of application running logs is small and takes up little space, and follows the principle of precision and accuracy. However, the client API access log designed for business analysis is different. It is the basic data of most statistical data and an important asset of the enterprise. Therefore, Turms defaults and recommends 100% sampling of it, which consumes a lot of storage.</p><p>Notice</p><ul><li><p>The data format design of all logs, metrics and link tracking in Turms is designed with &quot;simple and fast, convenient and fast query&quot; and &quot;accurate sampling, convenient for log service analysis&quot;, but Turms itself does not provide any log analysis function.</p></li><li><p>The log timestamp and log cutting of Turms are based on UTC time, not system time.</p></li><li><p>When Turms has <code>FATAL</code> level logs, manual intervention is required to fix them.

Turms will optimize this later to ensure that the log can be printed out in a timely manner. Of course, since the current system is equipped with a monitoring system, when the operation and maintenance personnel receive a warning that the storage space exceeds the custom threshold, they should deal with it in advance.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Turms will continuously print the log and print the log into a file for storage in the file system. When the storage space of the file system is insufficient, <strong>Turms server will stop printing logs</strong>, but will not discard the logs, but will accumulate the logs in the memory, so when too many logs accumulated in the memory and the memory is insufficient, <strong>It will also trigger the automatic protection mechanism of the Turms server to reject all user requests</strong>, so as to prevent the Turms server from going down due to insufficient memory. Therefore, the operation and maintenance personnel must ensure that the system where the Turms server is located has sufficient storage space at all times.</p><p>Further reading: <a href="https://turms-im.github.io/docs/server/module/system-resource-management#%E5%86%85%E5%AD%98%E5%81%A5%E5%BA%B7%E6%A3%80%E6%B5%8B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Memory health detection mechanism of Turms server</a></p></li></ul><h3 id="self-developed-implementation-expanding-knowledge" tabindex="-1">Self-developed implementation (expanding knowledge) <a class="header-anchor" href="#self-developed-implementation-expanding-knowledge" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Self-developed implementation (expanding knowledge)&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="reason" tabindex="-1">reason <a class="header-anchor" href="#reason" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;reason&quot;">​</a></h4><ol><li>Turms defaults and highly recommends 100% sampling of the client API, which requires efficient implementation of Logging</li><li>The implementation of third-party Logging is too redundant, with low performance and high memory usage</li><li>Avoid third-party Logging developers writing critical bugs like <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jfh8-c2jp-5v3q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Remote code injection in Log4j</a> due to lack of security common sense</li><li>The log implementation of Turms is &quot;almost no function implemented&quot;, and the implemented functions are also implemented according to almost the highest performance standard (we directly write the basic data of Java into <code>DirectByteBuf</code>, and directly write to the file descriptor , there is no string copy), so the throughput of this implementation can be several times higher than log4j2 async logger, and the memory overhead is several times higher</li></ol><h4 id="implementation" tabindex="-1">Implementation <a class="header-anchor" href="#implementation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Implementation&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The Turms log implementation is very streamlined, and only implements a few percent of the core functions of the standard log library. The main steps for printing logs are:</p><p>For regular logs:</p><pre><code>* Call `im.turms.server.common.infra.logging.core.logger.AsyncLogger#doLog` function\n* The `doLog` function internally allocates a block of off-heap memory through `PooledByteBufAllocator.DEFAULT`, and traverses the message, writes non-placeholders directly into this memory, skips placeholders and writes specific parameters, and finally writes this memory Put it in the MPSC queue for log processing (based on `MpscUnboundedArrayQueue` of jctools)\n* When the log processing thread detects that there is a new log (that is, the `ByteBuffer` object), it will write the off-heap memory to the `FileChannel` of the NIO package (it can be a console or a file). Under the system, `pwrite` will be called to directly write the off-heap memory into the file descriptor\n</code></pre><p>For various API logs (such as client API logs), we use a more customized implementation, namely:</p><ul><li>The caller directly writes API information (such as client IP, request size, etc.) into <code>DirectByteBuf</code>, and passes this Buffer to <code>AsyncLogger#doLog</code> function</li><li>The <code>doLog</code> function writes the general template information of the log (such as timestamp, node ID, etc.) into another <code>DirectByteBuf</code>, and splices it with the above <code>DirectByteBuf</code> to form a <code>CompositeByteBuf</code></li><li>When the log processing thread detects that there is a new log (that is, the <code>CompositeByteBuf</code> object), it will write the off-heap memory to the <code>FileChannel</code> of the NIO package (it can be a console or a file). Under the system, <code>pwrite</code> will be called to directly write the off-heap memory into the file descriptor</li></ul><p>Of course, the performance of Turms writing logs can reach the extreme.</p><p>Replenish</p><ul><li><p>Although there is a more efficient way of writing, that is, across the Java implementation, instead of using the <code>FileChannel</code> of the NIO package, it directly calls the underlying JNI implementation. Write to the file descriptor. However, considering the maintainability of the code, and Java does not open these underlying functions by default, this method is not adopted.</p></li><li><p>The memory mentioned above is allocated through <code>PooledByteBufAllocator.DEFAULT</code>, and there is no limit on the upper limit of memory usage, and &quot;dare&quot; to use <code>MpscUnboundedArrayQueue</code> to store logs without limiting the maximum capacity. This is because the Turms server has its own <a href="https://turms-im.github.io/docs/server/module/system-resource-management" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">memory management mechanism</a>, which can guarantee the upper limit of memory usage, At the same time, the used memory is gradually released.</p></li><li><p>Turms does not support and will not support in the future: add console text styling. Because you need to use <code>ANSI escape codes</code> to style the console text, and the log file does not need to store these characters, so to achieve this function, we need to maintain a ByteBuf for the console and the log file respectively, and a log needs to consume double memory, so the implementation is not considered.</p><p>In addition, developers can use third-party tools or plug-ins, such as the <code>Grep Console</code> plug-in of <code>Intellij IDEA</code>, to add styles to the logs of the Turms server console.</p></li><li><p>About &quot;why there are garbled characters when printing non-ASCII characters&quot;, this is because:</p><p>background:</p><ul><li>The <code>byte[] value</code> inside the Java 21 <code>String</code> class has and can only store <code>LATIN-1</code> or <code>UTF-16</code> encoded data</li><li><strong>Turms server itself has and only prints ASCII characters</strong> (Turms server will not print any text entered by users or administrators)</li><li>Log printing is a frequently used function, meaningless memory copying is absolutely prohibited.</li></ul><p>In the above background, when Turms prints <code>String</code>, it does not get its byte data through <code>getBytes(&quot;UTF-8&quot;)</code>, but directly obtains the internal <code>LATIN-1</code> of <code>String</code> through <code>Unsafe</code> Or <code>UTF-16</code> encoded byte data, so the log file may be <code>LATIN-1</code> and <code>UTF-16</code> mixed encoding.</p><p>When users view log files in <code>UTF-8</code> encoding, ASCII characters in <code>LATIN-1</code> encoding can be displayed correctly, and ASCII characters in <code>UTF-16</code> encoding can also be displayed, but each ASCII character will be more With a null character (binary encoding <code>0000 0000</code>), characters that are not compatible with other encodings will be displayed as garbled characters, so if the Turms server prints non-ASCII characters, the user will see garbled characters.</p><p>In addition, unless Java supports storing UTF-8 encoded byte data in the future, the Turms server will not consider using an inefficient implementation such as <code>getBytes(&quot;UTF-8&quot;)</code>.</p></li></ul><p>In summary, the supplementary content has once again verified what we have repeatedly mentioned in each chapter: &quot;multiple functions&quot; is likely to be a shortcoming for servers that pursue performance.</p><h3 id="reasons-for-not-using-json-format" tabindex="-1">Reasons for not using JSON format <a class="header-anchor" href="#reasons-for-not-using-json-format" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Reasons for not using JSON format&quot;">​</a></h3><p>With the development of microservices, logs in JSON format are becoming more and more popular. For example, MongoDB began to support logs in JSON format in version 4.4. There are three main advantages of using the JSON format:</p><ul><li>Greatly unified the log format of each server. Especially for companies with dozens/hundreds/thousands of heterogeneous servers, it is mandatory for each project to use the JSON log format</li><li>Each programming language has good support for JSON, and there is almost no difficulty in log printing and analysis</li><li>The log services of various cloud vendors have good support for logs in JSON format, which can be used out of the box</li></ul><p>The reasons why the Turms server does not use the JSON format are:</p><ul><li>The structure of the Turms server is very simple, and there is no need to unify the log format through JSON.</li><li>JSON serialization requires additional memory and CPU resources, and has a large storage overhead. If compression technology is used, additional CPU resources will be occupied. In particular, the CPU resources required for serialization plus compression are even higher than the CPU resources required by the Turms server to process business requests, which is unacceptable for Turms.</li><li>JSON format is actually not good in readability of raw data. Because the original log is displayed in a single line, a line represents an event. When the JSON format is displayed in a single line, it will bring a lot of &quot;noise&quot;. A large amount of JSON metadata, JSON keys and JSON values are criss-crossed. It is more laborious to read the original data directly. On the other hand, the client API access log of the Turms server uses <code>|</code> delimiters to split each field. Users only need to read a few more logs for the first time, and then they can reflect what information each field represents.</li></ul><p>Of course, adopting the traditional single-line format will cause relatively complicated cloud service parsing and inflexible configuration. However, considering that this kind of thing is configured once and for all, considering the above situation, the Turms server log does not use the JSON format, but still uses the traditional single-line format.</p><h3 id="category" tabindex="-1">Category <a class="header-anchor" href="#category" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Category&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="gc-log" tabindex="-1">GC log <a class="header-anchor" href="#gc-log" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;GC log&quot;">​</a></h4><p>It is used for JVM performance testing, analysis and tuning, and troubleshooting and positioning problems.</p><p>The server JVM GC configuration of turms-gateway is: <code>-Xlog:gc*,gc+age=trace,safepoint:file=${TURMS_GATEWAY_HOME}/log/turms-gateway-gc.log:utctime,pid,tags:filecount =32,filesize=32m</code></p><p>The server JVM GC configuration of turms-service is: <code>-Xlog:gc*,gc+age=trace,safepoint:file=${TURMS_SERVICE_HOME}/log/turms-service-gc.log:utctime,pid,tags:filecount =32,filesize=32m</code></p><h4 id="server-running-log" tabindex="-1">Server running log <a class="header-anchor" href="#server-running-log" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Server running log&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Describe the main events that occur in the Turms server, such as the transition of the RPC connection state, the occurrence of server-side errors in request processing, etc.</p><p>File name: <code>turms-gateway.log</code> (turms-gateway server); <code>turms-service.log</code> (turms-service server)</p><p>Composition: event sending time, log level, server type, node ID, trace ID, thread, class, message.

However, compared with dozens, hundreds or even thousands of microservice applications, Turms&#39; call link is extremely simple, and there is no need to track requests through Span information. Also, if Turms is implemented using standard OpenTracing, the link tracing additional information for many requests will be even larger than the body of most RPC requests.</p><p>Therefore, Turms only adds a field for <code>trace ID</code> to all logs.
