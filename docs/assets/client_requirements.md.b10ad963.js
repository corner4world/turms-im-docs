The main reason is that the Android SDK does not provide a set of standard TLS protocol implementations for <code>SocketChannel</code>, which needs to be implemented by itself. Considering the variety of Android systems and the limited system functions (especially compared to server-side implementations), self-implementation of the TLS protocol can easily lead to various unexpected bugs, so use <code>Socket</code> to implement the official TLS protocol .</li></ul>',5),n=[i];function a(d,l,c,m,p,u){return t(),o("div",null,n)}const _=e(s,[["render",a]]);export{f as __pageData,_ as default};
